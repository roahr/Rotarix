# Rotarix - AI Driven Automated Cryptographic Key Rotation with Blockchain Auditing

## Overview
Rotarix is a cryptographic key management and rotation system designed to enhance security through automated key lifecycle management. It integrates **quantum-resistant key generation, blockchain-based audit logging, AI-driven threat detection, and fine-grained access control.**

## Project Structure

  - Key Rotation Status (Last rotation timestamp, next scheduled rotation)
  - Real-Time Threat Alerts (Live notifications on detected security risks)
- **Live System Monitoring**
  - AI-based Anomaly Detection Logs (Flagged security incidents)
  - Graphical Trends (Past rotations, threat levels)
  - Log Sources & Health Status (Connected SIEMs, Cloud Logs, etc.)
- **Key Management**
  - Display all active cryptographic keys (AES, RSA, Kyber, etc.)
  - Key expiration & usage tracking
  - Auto-Rotation (On/Off toggle)
  - Manual Key Rotation (Immediate key change trigger)
  - Rotation Frequency Settings (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Custom)

  - View immutable logs (Hyperledger/Ethereum-based event tracking)
  - Timestamped event history
  - Tamper-proof verification
  - Log Filtering & Search by time, severity, key type, user
  - Smart Contract Details (Deployed contract address, query transactions)
- **Security Alerts & Notifications**
  - Incident Response Panel (AI-detected high-risk incidents, unauthorized key access attempts, AI confidence score)
  - Admin Notifications (Email & Slack Alerts for key rotations, anomalies, in-dashboard critical alerts)
  - Audit Reports (Download compliance reports: PCI-DSS, GDPR, HIPAA; generate security logs in CSV, JSON, PDF)
- **Settings & Integrations**
  - SIEM & Cloud Log Integrations (AWS, Azure, Splunk, ELK, HashiCorp Vault)
  - Encryption algorithm selection
  - API keys for external services
  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) permissions for Admins, Security Analysts, and Auditors
  - Webhooks for external event triggers
